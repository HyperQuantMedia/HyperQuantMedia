NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
(Applicable to All Hyper Quant Media Source-Control Repositories)

This Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into by HyperQuant Media LLP and between all users with access to any repos:

Hyper Quant Media, a company duly organized and existing under the laws of India, with its principal place of business at [Complete Address] (“Disclosing Party”);
and
[Name of Recipient], an individual or entity with residence/registered office at [Complete Address] (“Receiving Party”).

Disclosing Party and Receiving Party may be referred to collectively as the “Parties” or individually as a “Party.”

1. Definitions
1.1 “Confidential Information” means all proprietary information, trade secrets, technical data, business plans, source code (including, without limitation, all Git, Perforce, or any other source-control repositories), design documents, algorithms, models, know-how, customer lists, marketing strategies, financial information, and any other non-public information disclosed or made available (whether in written, oral, electronic, or any other form) by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party, whether before or after the Effective Date (as defined in Section 2).
1.2 “Authorized Persons” means Receiving Party’s employees, contractors, consultants, or agents who (a) need to know the Confidential Information to perform services for the Receiving Party in connection with the Purpose (Section 2), (b) are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth herein, and (c) have been approved in writing by Disclosing Party.
1.3 “Repositories” means all existing and future source-control repositories (Git, Perforce, SVN, Mercurial, or any other system) owned, licensed, or otherwise provided by Hyper Quant Media, including all hosted on GitHub, Perforce servers, or any third-party platform.

2. Effective Date and Purpose
2.1 Effective Date. This Agreement becomes effective with respect to any Receiving Party as of the exact date on which that person or entity is granted access to any Hyper Quant Media Repository—that is, the moment GitHub or any other source-control system logs that the individual has accepted an invitation or access request to join a Repository—unless, prior to joining, the Receiving Party has executed a separate, exclusive confidentiality agreement expressly stating alternate terms (“Exclusive Document”). In that event, the Effective Date for that Receiving Party shall be the later of (a) the date they execute this Agreement or (b) the date they attain repository access under the Exclusive Document.
2.2 Purpose. Receiving Party agrees to receive and use Confidential Information exclusively for the purpose of evaluating, developing, maintaining, or supporting software applications and game-development projects under the Hyper Quant Media organization (the “Purpose”).

3. Applicability to All Repositories
3.1 Scope of Coverage. By accepting access to any Hyper Quant Media Repository, Receiving Party automatically becomes bound by this Agreement with respect to all Confidential Information contained in any Repository—current or future—under the Hyper Quant Media organization. No additional signature or amendment is required for each individual repository.
3.2 Excluded Repositories. If Receiving Party has an Exclusive Document that explicitly governs confidentiality or grants additional rights/permissions for a specific Repository, the terms of that Exclusive Document shall govern for that Repository alone; all other Repositories remain governed by this Agreement.

4. Obligations of Receiving Party
4.1 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use. Receiving Party shall not disclose, publish, or disseminate Confidential Information to any third party except to Authorized Persons strictly on a need-to-know basis. Receiving Party shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose.
4.2 Standard of Care. Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care.
4.3 No Reverse Engineering or Copying. Receiving Party shall not, and shall not permit any Authorized Person to, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, copy, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the Confidential Information, including source code, except as expressly permitted in writing by Disclosing Party.
4.4 Notification of Unauthorized Use. Receiving Party shall promptly notify Disclosing Party in writing upon discovery of any unauthorized use, disclosure, or misappropriation of Confidential Information.
4.5 GitHub/Source-Control Tracking. Receiving Party acknowledges that GitHub (and/or any other source-control system used by Hyper Quant Media) will automatically log each instance of repository-access acceptance. Such logs constitute conclusive evidence of the Effective Date for purposes of this Agreement.

5. Exclusions from Confidential Information
Confidential Information does not include information that Receiving Party can demonstrate by written record:
5.1 Was already known to Receiving Party at the time of disclosure (and not subject to another NDA);
5.2 Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of Receiving Party;
5.3 Is rightfully received from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation;
5.4 Is independently developed by Receiving Party without use of or reference to Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or
5.5 Is required to be disclosed by law or by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided Receiving Party gives Disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement and cooperates with Disclosing Party’s attempt to seek a protective order or other remedy.

6. Term and Termination
6.1 This Agreement shall remain in force with respect to each Receiving Party for as long as they have access to any Hyper Quant Media Repository and shall survive termination or expiration of their access for a period of three (3) years from the date they last accessed that Repository.
6.2 Either Party may terminate this Agreement with respect to a particular Receiving Party upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to a Receiving Party, that Party shall (a) cease all use of Confidential Information; (b) destroy or return to Disclosing Party all materials containing Confidential Information (including all copies, summaries, and excerpts) within ten (10) days; and (c) certify in writing to Disclosing Party that such destruction or return has been completed. Notwithstanding termination, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use set forth herein shall remain in effect for three (3) years from the date of termination with respect to Confidential Information disclosed during the Term.

7. Ownership
All Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) and any derivations, enhancements, improvements, or modifications thereto are and shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any ownership, license (express or implied), or any other rights, by estoppel or otherwise, to Receiving Party in or to any Confidential Information.

8. No Warranty
All Confidential Information is provided “AS IS.” Disclosing Party makes no warranties, express, implied, or statutory, regarding the accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose of the Confidential Information and disclaims any and all liability arising from Receiving Party’s use thereof.

9. Remedies
9.1 Injunctive Relief. Receiving Party acknowledges that any actual or threatened unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Accordingly, Disclosing Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, to seek injunctive relief to restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages.
9.2 Attorneys’ Fees. In the event of any legal action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses.

10. Return or Destruction of Materials
Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement (or upon written request by Disclosing Party at any time), Receiving Party shall promptly (a) return to Disclosing Party all Confidential Information (including all copies, summaries, notes, extracts, and reproductions) and (b) permanently delete any electronic files or copies containing Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall provide written certification of such return or deletion within ten (10) days of Disclosing Party’s request.

11. No Assignment
Receiving Party may not assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party. Any unauthorized assignment shall be null and void.

12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of India, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The Parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New Delhi, India, for any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

13. Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a substitute provision to carry out the original intention.

14. Entire Agreement
This Agreement, together with any applicable Exclusive Document, constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, and understandings, whether written or oral. Any amendments or modifications must be in writing and signed by both Parties.

15. Notices
All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at their respective addresses set forth at the beginning of this Agreement (or to such other address as a Party may designate by notice in accordance with this Section). Notices shall be deemed to have been given when:

(c) sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt); or
